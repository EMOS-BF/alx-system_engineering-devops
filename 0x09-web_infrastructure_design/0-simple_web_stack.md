Description
This is a server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com.
We  use:
1 server
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)
1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
Specifics About This Infrastructure

=>A server is a computer or a program that provides services to other computers or programs.

=>A domain name is a human-readable label that identifies a website or a network. The role of the domain name is to provide a memorable and easily recognizable name that users can use to access the website. The DNS record www is a subdomain that points to the IP address of the server hosting the website.

=>The www record is an A record, which maps a domain name to an IP address.

=>The role of the web server, in this case, Nginx, is to serve static content and pass dynamic content requests to the application server. It also handles incoming connections, load balancing, and security.

=>The role of the application server is to run your code base, process requests, and generate responses.

=>The role of the database, in this case, MySQL, is to store and manage the data used by your application.

=>The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website.

Issues With This Infrastructure

=>Single point of failure (SPOF): If the server goes down, the website will become inaccessible. To address this, you could add redundancy by using multiple servers, load balancers, and a failover mechanism.

=>Downtime during maintenance: When deploying new code or updating the server software, the web server needs to be restarted, which may cause downtime. To address this, you could use rolling deployments, where you update the servers one at a time, or use redundant servers and load balancers to ensure high availability during maintenance.

=>Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: This infrastructure may not be able to handle a sudden surge of incoming traffic, which may cause the website to become slow or unavailable. To address this, you could add more servers and use load balancers to distribute the traffic evenly. You could also use caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) to reduce the load on your servers.
