=>Description

Load Balancer Server:
The first server is a load balancer server that routes incoming traffic between two web servers. The load balancer helps distribute the incoming traffic evenly across both servers, ensuring that no single server becomes overloaded with requests. In this infrastructure, we will use HAproxy as the load balancer.

Web Servers:
The second and third servers are web servers that are responsible for serving web pages to users. We will use Nginx as the web server.

Application Server:
The fourth server is the application server that runs the web application. The application server is responsible for processing user requests and returning appropriate responses. In this infrastructure, we will use Apache or Node.js as the application server.

Database Server:
The fifth server is the database server that stores all the website data. We will use MySQL as the database server.

Application Files:
The set of application files is the code base that runs the web application. These files will be hosted on the application server.

=>specifics about this infrastructure

We are adding the load balancer to ensure that traffic is evenly distributed between the two web servers. This helps to prevent overloading of a single server and improves the performance of the website.

HAproxy is a well-known open-source software that is used as a load balancer. It uses round-robin distribution, which means that it forwards requests to each server in turn.

The load balancer is enabling an Active-Passive setup, which means that only one server is active at a time. If the active server fails, the passive server will take over.

The Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works by having one primary node that handles all writes to the database, and one or more replica nodes that receive copies of the data from the primary node. The replica nodes are read-only and are used for handling read requests. This architecture provides redundancy and ensures data consistency.

The primary node is responsible for handling all writes to the database, while the replica nodes only handle read requests. In regard to the application, the primary node is the authoritative source of data, and any changes made to the database are immediately available to the application.

=>Issues With This Infrastructure

SPOF: The infrastructure has a single load balancer, which can become a single point of failure. If the load balancer fails, the website will become unavailable. To address this issue, we can set up a secondary load balancer in a different availability zone or data center.

Security issues: The infrastructure has no firewall or HTTPS, making it vulnerable to attacks. We should implement a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic and HTTPS to secure communication between the server and the client.

No monitoring: The infrastructure lacks monitoring tools to track server performance and detect potential issues. We should implement monitoring tools like Nagios or Zabbix to monitor server health and ensure optimal performance.
